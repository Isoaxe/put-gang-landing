# Put Gang Landing

The Put Gang project is broken into two repositories: `put-gang-landing` and `put-gang-console`. The former is just a landing page from which the signup flow is initialized. The customer completes the Stripe payment flow from here via modals. Some data is then passed to `put-gang-console` via params, where the Firebase user is created. This gives access to a dashboard / console where either just `<Settings/>` are displayed (for junior users) or full MLM access (for senior users).
